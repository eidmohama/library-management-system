Library Management System (MySQL Project)

This project implements a **Library & Book Borrowing Management System** using MySQL.
It is designed to manage the main operations of a library, including members, books, authors, borrowing records, and payment tracking.
The system supports **CRUD operations**, **JOIN queries**, and **Aggregation functions** for data analysis.
Database Structure
The database includes the following tables:
1)	Members
2)	Authors
3)	Categories
4)	Books
5)	Book_Authors (Many-to-Many)
6)	Borrowings
7)	Payments
All tables are linked using **Foreign Keys** to maintain data integrity.
